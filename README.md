# gnome-blur-test

## Testing current state of GNOME background blur.

Status: Seems to be working!

But we need some way to mask parts that should not have the blur (shadows, round corners...).

### Install

Clone to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/gnome-blur-test@pikachunakapika

Restart gnome-shell (alt+f2, r).

Activate extension.
